### Project: Understanding and diving deep into the Python package Selenium.
Goals: Jumping into Selenium with Python to execute web automation and web scraping. 

### Instructions for Use
First go to the Selenium Tutorial file to learn more about the selenium package. The tutorial includes the package capabilities, installation, how to use, and troubleshooting.

Example Code:
To see how to open a browser, search, and take a screenshot check out the file called "search-frogs" as this has code to search the USGS data website and search for frogs and capture and image of the page.

To see how to scrape and store data from a website using automated searching and processes check out the file titled "storing-frogs". This does similar steps as the searching-frogs in going to the website and searching. However, instead of taking a screenshot and closing the page, it will scrape the website based on class and store this data in a csv file.
